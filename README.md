# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

Hello, my name is Peter Zajac! 🚀 I'm a Computer Science student at Pan-European University in Bratislava. 🎓 

## About Me🧑‍💻

My passion for programming started about half a year ago, and since then, I've been dedicating my free time to learn and enhance my skills. I have primarily been focusing on JavaScript and React as my initial stepping stones in this field. As a beginner, I aspire to become a web developer and I am committed to making this vision a reality. 

Web development intrigues me not just because of the coding aspect but also the potential for creativity it offers. Designing websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly is a skill I am currently developing. I am thrilled about the journey ahead, where I'll be able to transform concepts into fully functional websites.

I'm also gaining practical experience while working for BeCode s.r.o. Here, I have the opportunity to manage websites and publish articles, which has helped me gain a rounded understanding of the content aspect of web development.

## Projects 🛠️

I have ventured into a few projects, though they are primarily guided by tutorials and online courses, especially on Scrimba. But they are essential milestones in my learning curve, showing the progress I've made over the months. I am currently taking a React course, and alongside that, I am working on improving my programming skills.

## Collaboration 🤝

While I continue to expand my knowledge and skills, I'm eager to work on more complex projects to accelerate my learning and gain practical experience. Collaborative projects offer a great platform for this, and I'm always open to such opportunities. If you're interested in teaming up or have a project in mind where I could contribute, please don't hesitate to get in touch. You can reach me at zajacp011@gmail.com. I'm excited to start this journey with you!
